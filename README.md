## What I Do

I design and build systems at the intersection of:

- **Artificial Intelligence & Computer Vision**  
  Applied ML, image processing, and production-ready AI systems.

- **Automation & Robotics Engineering**  
  Industrial automation, PLC programming, control systems, and robotics.

- **Software & Systems Engineering**  
  Cross-platform tooling, system-level programming, and Linux-based workflows.

The focus is always on **reliable, real-world systems**, not demos.
